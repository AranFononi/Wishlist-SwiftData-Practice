# Wish List 🎯❤️  

### Learning SwiftData & SwiftUI  

This is my latest project from the **SwiftUI Masterclass**, where I built a **Wishlist app** to explore **SwiftData** for data persistence in SwiftUI. 🚀  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This app allows users to **create, save, and manage a wishlist** with a smooth and simple UI. The goal was to get hands-on experience with **SwiftData**, leveraging its features for efficient data handling.  

## 🚀 What I Focused On  
- **SwiftData:** Used `@Model`, `@Query`, and `@Environment(\.modelContext)` to manage data persistence.  
- **SwiftUI:** Built a clean, responsive UI with **dynamic lists, toolbars, and swipe actions**.  
- **Alerts & Overlays:** Implemented an intuitive way to add new wishes with `Alert` and `ContentUnavailableView`.  
- **Optimized User Experience:** Added **dynamic wish count tracking** and an empty state placeholder.  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ **Create & save wishes** with SwiftData  
✅ **Swipe-to-delete** functionality  
✅ **Dynamic wish count** in the toolbar  
✅ **Empty state UI** when no wishes exist  
✅ **Live preview support** for better development
